# netcrafter
Parses NetCraft site reports to file

Originally this was intended to be a web scraper of sorts, but I quickly discovered that NetCraft has some multi-layered protection against web scraping including user-agent detection and javascript redirection. For now the NetCraft site report must be manually downloaded and fed into this script.

Maybe one day I'll figure out a way to get around their mechanisms using Cypress or something.

Anyways, this isn't the most useful tool. It was more of a learning activity.

Happy Hacking!
