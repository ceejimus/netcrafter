# netcrafter
Parses NetCraft site reports to file

Originally this was intended to be a web scraper of sorts, but I quickly discovered that NetCraft has some multi-layered protection against web scraping including user-agent detection and javascript redirection. For now the NetCraft site report must be manually downloaded and fed into this script.

Maybe one day I'll figure out a way to get around their mechanisms as I very much do not support the attitude of "prevent robots from using our site." It's not a video game... bots should be allowed. If it's something about rate-limiting then they should develop and API with build in keys and an underlying rate-limiting mechanism.

Anyways, this isn't the most useful tool anyways it's more of a learning activity.

Happy Hacking!
